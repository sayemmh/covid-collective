    "We are a team of American medical students working with board certified physicians crowdsourcing information on the characteristics, symptoms, and presentation of COVID-19. Healthcare personnel are struggling with the variable presentation and course of COVID-19 and we must rely on the experiences of each other to address it. The data will enable researchers to find insights and give healthcare workers on the front line with the most up to date information on the illness. Any information that you provide is completely anonymous and could help save lives.",
